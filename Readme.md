# A Compiler Writing Journey

In this Github repository, I'm documenting my journey to writing a
self-compiling compiler in only five days.

This was our final project for the university course: Automata Theory.

The project developed my understanding of tokenization, parsing, and semantic analysis.

Here are the steps I've implemented:

 + [Part  0](00_Introduction/Readme.md):  Introduction to the Journey
 + [Part  1](01_Scanner/Readme.md):       Introduction to Lexical Scanning
 + [Part  2](02_Parser/Readme.md):        Introduction to Parsing
 + [Part  3](03_Precedence/Readme.md):    Operator Precedence
 + [Part  4](04_Assembly/Readme.md):      An Actual Compiler
 
## Copyrights

I have borrowed some of the code, and lots of ideas, from the 
[SubC](http://www.t3x.org/subc/) compiler written by Nils M Holm.
His code is in the public domain. I think that my code is substantially
different enough that I can apply a different license to my code.

Unless otherwise noted,

 + all source code and scripts are (c) Warren Toomey under
   the GPL3 license.
 + all non-source code documents (e.g. English documents,
   image files) are (c) Warren Toomey under the Creative
   Commons BY-NC-SA 4.0 license.
